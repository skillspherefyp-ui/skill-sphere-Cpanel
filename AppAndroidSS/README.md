## 🛠 Helper Scripts

All helper scripts are in the `scripts/` folder:

- **`kill-metro.ps1`** / **`kill-metro.bat`** - Kill Metro bundler if port 8081 is in use
- **`fix-java17-complete.ps1`** - Fix Java 17 configuration issues
- **`fix-all-build-errors.ps1`** - Clean all build caches

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Kill Metro bundler (if port 8081 is busy)
.\scripts\kill-metro.ps1

# Fix Java 17 configuration
.\scripts\fix-java17-complete.ps1
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Android Build Issues

1. **Port 8081 already in use**:
   ```powershell
   # Run the kill script
   .\scripts\kill-metro.ps1
   # Or manually:
   netstat -ano | findstr :8081
   taskkill /F /PID <PID>
   ```

2. **Clean build**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npm run android
   ```

3. **Clear Metro cache**:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```

4. **Java version errors**:
   ```powershell
   # Run the Java 17 fix script
   .\scripts\fix-java17-complete.ps1
   ```

### iOS Build Issues

1. **Reinstall pods**:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

### Vector Icons Not Showing

**Android**: Add to `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```
